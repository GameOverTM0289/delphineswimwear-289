          <h2>What we <em>collect</em></h2>
          <p>
            When you place an order, we collect your name, email address, phone number, shipping
            address, and payment confirmation from our payment provider. We never see or store your
            card number.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you contact us, we keep the message and your email so we can reply. When you
            subscribe to our newsletter, we keep your email until you unsubscribe.
          </p>
          <p>
            We use a small amount of website analytics (page views, referrer, country) to
            understand which pages people read. This is aggregated and does not identify you.
          </p>

          <h2>How we <em>use it</em></h2>
          <ul>
            <li>To process and ship your order.</li>
            <li>To answer your questions when you write to us.</li>
            <li>To send you the newsletter, only if you have asked for it.</li>
            <li>To meet our legal obligations (tax, fraud prevention, accounting).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We do not sell your data, and we do not share it with anyone outside the partners we
            need to fulfil your order — our shipping carrier, our payment processor, and our email
            provider. Each is bound by their own privacy obligations.
          </p>

          <h2>How long we <em>keep it</em></h2>
          <p>
            Order data is retained for 7 years to meet accounting requirements. Contact-form
            messages are kept for 2 years. Newsletter subscriptions are kept until you unsubscribe.
          </p>

          <h2>Your <em>rights</em></h2>
          <p>
            You can ask us at any time to access, correct, delete, or export your personal data.
            Email <Link href="/contact">hello@delphine.com</Link> and we will respond within 30
            days. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your national data protection
            authority.
          </p>

          <h2>Cookies</h2>
          <p>
            We use a small number of strictly-necessary cookies — for example, to keep your bag
            full as you browse, and to keep you signed in if you’re an admin. We don’t use
            advertising or tracking cookies.
          </p>

          <h2>Changes to this <em>policy</em></h2>
          <p>
            If we make material changes, we will post a notice at the top of this page and update
            the date above. Continued use of the site after a change indicates acceptance.
          </p>
