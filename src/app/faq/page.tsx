const faqs = [
  {
    q: 'How do I find my size?',
    a: 'Our pieces are designed to fit a Mediterranean silhouette — true to size, with a soft second-skin feel. Each product page lists XS through XL. If you are between sizes, we recommend sizing up for one-pieces and staying true to size for bikinis.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Where is Delphine made?',
    a: 'Every Delphine piece is conceived and made in our atelier on the Mediterranean coast, in small batches by a team of four. Each garment is hand-finished and quality-checked before it ships.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How should I care for my swimwear?',
    a: 'Hand-wash in cold fresh water after every wear. Avoid wringing — gently press out water and lay flat in the shade to dry. Keep away from chlorine, sunscreen residue, and rough surfaces. Treated this way, a Delphine piece will last seasons.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What is your shipping timeline?',
    a: 'Orders are dispatched within two business days. Standard shipping takes 4–7 business days within Europe, 7–14 worldwide. Tracking is provided. See our Shipping page for full details.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I return or exchange a piece?',
    a: 'Yes — within 14 days of receipt, in unworn condition with original hygiene liner intact. See our Returns page for the full process.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do you offer gift cards?',
    a: 'Digital gift cards are coming soon. In the meantime, we are happy to arrange a personal gift order — please email hello@delphine.com.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Will you restock a sold-out piece?',
    a: 'Most pieces are produced in a single run for the season. If a piece is sold out, it may return in a future capsule — but we cannot guarantee it. Subscribe via our Contact page to be notified.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How can I get in touch?',
    a: 'Email hello@delphine.com or use the form on our Contact page. We read every message and respond within two business days.',
  },
